# AI Concept Map

This is the development repo for the AI Concept Map (AICM), a project originally started by me and hosted on my website 7[here](http://www.mattrasto.me/workshop/ai-concept-map/).

## Usage

The application is completely self-contained, so all you need to do to open the visualization is download / clone the repo and open `ai_concept_map.html`. From there, the visualization should be pretty intuitive. If not, make an issue!

## Contributing

I'm glad to accept any improvements, especially if they reference a specific issue.

If you are editing the visualization itself:

1. Add an issue explaining the suggested changes and motivations behind them
2. Once I've tagged your issue as valid or commented on it, work on the changes in your cloned repo
3. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch

If you are editing a node's or link's info:

1. (Optional) Make an issue explaining what you're adding / editing and why
1. Work on the changes in your cloned repo
2. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch either referencing your issue (if you made one) or explaining your changes

If you make any changes, I'll gladly credit you in the next live update :)
